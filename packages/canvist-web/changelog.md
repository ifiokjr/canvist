## [0.1.1](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/releases/tag/v0.1.1) (2026-10-20)

### 🚀 Feature

#### Edit on the web: EditContext input, IME, clipboard, drag and drop, accessibility

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #140](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/140)

- Text arrives through `EditContext` in Chromium, with the paragraph and caret bounds the platform's input methods need, and through a hidden textarea everywhere else. `input: "textarea"` forces the textarea, as a kill switch for `EditContext` problems.
- Compositions from input methods and dead keys show as preedit text and commit in place. Key bindings follow the platform (`Mod` is Cmd on Apple devices), detected from the browser or set with `platform`.
- Click, Shift-click, double-click, and triple-click select; dragging extends by the unit the press selected. Copy, cut, and paste carry HTML and plain text; the selection can be dragged to move or copy it, and drops from other applications land where they fall.
- A visually hidden copy of the document, the same semantic HTML the server renders, is refreshed on idle for screen readers and find-in-page.
- Every input event is painted in its own task. `editor.inputLatency()` reports input-to-paint times; the browser tests hold their 95th percentile under 8 ms and type a 1,000-key burst without dropping a key.
- `Engine::with_platform` in `canvist_headless` chooses what `Mod` means in key bindings.

#### React and Vue bindings, and hydrating server-rendered HTML

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #141](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/141)

- `@canvist/react` adds `useCanvistEditor`, `useEditorState` (through `useSyncExternalStore`), and `<CanvistEditor />`. `@canvist/vue` adds the same composables and a component that emits `ready` and `update`. Both are typed from the extensions and plugins you register.
- `editor.subscribe(listener)` in `@canvist/web` calls back after every document or selection change.
- `createEditor` hydrates server-rendered HTML: given an element holding canvist's `.cv-doc` markup, it reads the document from it, keeps it on screen until fonts settle, and swaps in the canvas in one frame, with no layout shift.
- `examples/web` shows a plain page, React, Vue, and a page rendered by the new `ssr_page` example in `canvist_headless`, with Playwright tests in every browser.

#### Add `@canvist/web`, the canvas editor for the browser, with a fonts plugin

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #137](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/137)

- `@canvist/web` and `canvist_web` paint the document on an opaque Canvas2D context with HiDPI backing stores, dirty-rectangle repaints, and baselines and backgrounds snapped to the browser's own pixel grid. `createEditor` types commands, queries, and plugin APIs from what you register.
- Text is measured by the browser: `measureText` advances with kerning placed as shapers place it, line boxes read from the DOM, family lists resolved to the face the DOM uses, and DOM ranges for Arabic and for Firefox's fractional sizes. The canvas wraps where server-rendered HTML does.
- `@canvist/web/fonts` loads faces from URLs or bytes with `unicode-range` and `font-display`, builds metric-compatible fallbacks, lists local fonts through `queryLocalFonts`, and writes the same faces as `@font-face` CSS for SSR.
- `canvist_layout`: `TextMeasurer` batches carry line-box requests that a measurer may answer; `DocumentLayout::forget_fonts` relays out only the blocks a loaded face affects; `measure_stats`, `line_ranges`, `fonts`, and `font_metrics`; kerning between adjacent segments; `chromium_breaks`; border widths snapped to device pixels; `Theme::starter_kit_with` for dark and custom-font themes, and `Chrome::background`. `to_html` now sets the background and `text-spacing-trim: normal`, the StarterKit code stack no longer names `ui-monospace`, and graphemes come from the editor's segmenter. `ParleyMeasurer` sets a variable font's optical size to the font size, as browsers do.
- `canvist_headless`: `Doc::edit` runs editor calls with a host's clock and line navigator, and `Doc::command_named` resolves a named command.
- `@canvist/headless` exports its generated extension descriptors at `@canvist/headless/extensions`, with no WebAssembly.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Move the repository to canvist/canvist.** canvist now lives at [github.com/canvist/canvist](https://github.com/canvist/canvist). Every repository, documentation, and badge link points there, the npm packages declare their repository, homepage, and issue tracker (with support@canvist.dev), and the release workflows run for the `canvist` organisation. The website footer has a Contact link to support@canvist.dev. _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #148](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/148)

#### Fit the web editor in its 350 KB budget

_Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) · _Review:_ [PR #137](https://github.com/canvist/canvist/pull/137)

- `@canvist/web` now ships 349.8 KB gzipped, measured as an app bundles it (`npm run size`, enforced in CI). The WebAssembly module is optimized without inlining, which gzips smaller.
- `canvist_layout::css_number` formats CSS numbers without `core`'s float formatting, which no longer links into the module.
- `EditorState::change` and `InputRule::new` keep one copy of their logic instead of one per command and rule, and `Engine::metadata` is built on first use.
