Add `canvist_cloud`, the canvist Cloud server, starting with Sync: a multi-tenant y-sync relay.

- Stock `y-websocket` and Hocuspocus clients connect to `/v1/sync/{document}` and `/v1/hocuspocus`, with presence, read-only sessions, and per-document access from short-lived HS256 tokens that API keys mint.
- Documents persist to Postgres as merged Yjs updates, compact into snapshots, and leave memory once idle. Updates that write outside the `blocks` root or put bare values in it are refused.
- Debounced, signed `document.updated` webhooks; REST endpoints to list, read, write, and delete documents; health and readiness probes; and a graceful shutdown that persists every room.
- `canvist_collab::Reorder` is now public, so hosts with a bare yrs document apply out-of-order updates safely.
