# Add `@canvist/web`, the canvas editor for the browser, with a fonts plugin

- `@canvist/web` and `canvist_web` paint the document on an opaque Canvas2D context with HiDPI backing stores, dirty-rectangle repaints, and baselines and backgrounds snapped to the browser's own pixel grid. `createEditor` types commands, queries, and plugin APIs from what you register.
- Text is measured by the browser: `measureText` advances with kerning placed as shapers place it, line boxes read from the DOM, family lists resolved to the face the DOM uses, and DOM ranges for Arabic and for Firefox's fractional sizes. The canvas wraps where server-rendered HTML does.
- `@canvist/web/fonts` loads faces from URLs or bytes with `unicode-range` and `font-display`, builds metric-compatible fallbacks, lists local fonts through `queryLocalFonts`, and writes the same faces as `@font-face` CSS for SSR.
- `canvist_layout`: `TextMeasurer` batches carry line-box requests that a measurer may answer; `DocumentLayout::forget_fonts` relays out only the blocks a loaded face affects; `measure_stats`, `line_ranges`, `fonts`, and `font_metrics`; kerning between adjacent segments; `chromium_breaks`; border widths snapped to device pixels; `Theme::starter_kit_with` for dark and custom-font themes, and `Chrome::background`. `to_html` now sets the background and `text-spacing-trim: normal`, the StarterKit code stack no longer names `ui-monospace`, and graphemes come from the editor's segmenter. `ParleyMeasurer` sets a variable font's optical size to the font size, as browsers do.
- `canvist_headless`: `Doc::edit` runs editor calls with a host's clock and line navigator, and `Doc::command_named` resolves a named command.
- `@canvist/headless` exports its generated extension descriptors at `@canvist/headless/extensions`, with no WebAssembly.
