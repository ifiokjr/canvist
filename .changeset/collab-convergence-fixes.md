# Fix three ways collaborating peers' documents could diverge

- A block copy that loses its id to a concurrently moved copy is now evicted from where it sits in the shared array, not from its old place in the model. Blocks inserted after it in the same update used to land out of order on the receiving peer.
- A hidden copy of a block, such as one inside a list that no longer allows it, no longer claims the block's id when reading a document from scratch. `Binding::document` used to hide the shown copy and delete it from the shared document.
- `Reorder::take_ready` is replaced by `Reorder::take_next`, which releases one update at a time against the document's current state vector. An update that yrs keeps pending, because it is inserted next to another client's item that has not arrived, no longer lets that client's later updates overtake it. The binding and canvist Sync rooms both apply updates this way.
